### About 👩‍⚕me👩‍⚕️




I am a self-thought web developer.
Identifying priorities will allow the flexibility to adjust 
towards changing requirements in any given situation.  
*Being a problem solver by nature with an array of relevant skills and assets, allows me to be capable of meeting dead 
lines, paying attention to detail and make sure any given task is completed. 
** 🚵🏼‍♀️What I do when I am not coding, bycicling is my favorite type of work out at the moment. 
**Gardening 🎋 allows me to create a new design of nature each year, as I believe in green planet 
survival and that we sindividuals play a role of huge importance. 
This year project is how to 
start an apple tree, it seems hard but I know the day I see that first apple on the 🪴 tree.
I feel confident that I would make an excellent candidate for your project👩🏼‍.
